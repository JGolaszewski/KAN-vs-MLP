## About

The project explores:
- Performance comparison between KAN and MLP models
- Visualization of decision boundaries and behaviors
- Analysis of model complexity and learning efficiency
- Investigation into KAN’s unique capabilities

The goal is to evaluate the practical usefulness of KANs in comparison to traditional MLPs across several standard benchmarks.
